# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: John Salik
Written in Python, these examples are designed to follow-up on classroom teaching.  The introductory course is meant to provide a detailled overview of various AI algorithms following a methodology that relies on the intuition behind important mathematical formulations rather than a detailled treatment of the mathematics directly.  This allows for a pedagogy that trades off between blindly using off-the-shelf AI tools such as Tensorflow, and going deep into mathematical formulations that require advanced studies.

### Lab 1
#### Exercise 1: Working with Tabular Data in a file.
1. Read data from a file and store it in memory.
2. Determine the dimensions of the data.
3. Perform a computation on the data.
4. Plot data based on computation.
#### Exercise 2: Synthesize Random 1D Test Data.
### Lab 2 
#### Exercise 1: Find a signal embedded in noise.
#### Exercise 2: Synthesize Random 2D Test Data.
### Lab 3
#### Exercise 1: Create an error surface for a regression problem.
#### Exercise 2: Given a data set, find the best fit model and make a prediction based on it.
### Lab 4
#### Exercise 1: Train a perceptron to separate data into two classes.  Use the learned decision line to classify new data.
#### Exercise 2: Use the LMS algorithm in a simulation of active noise cancellation.
